This is a script (set of scripts) to run basic Geometric Morphometric analyses in R 

This is a script that runs geometric morphometrics in R based on some data on filsh collected from the west Islnad of Montreal during the 2024 field season. The script loads a readied  '.TPS' file into R using the geomoprh 'readland.tps' cmd. The data come across scaled (based scaling was included during landmarking), and each individual's landmark configuration is loaded. Individuals are identified from their ID entry that was fixed during landmarking as well. The script will also read another file containing the metadata (in csv format) which are the environmental variables collected during sampling.
